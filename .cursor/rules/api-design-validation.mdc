# API Design & Validation Rules

## RESTful Endpoints
- All endpoints must be RESTful and versioned under `/api/v1/`.
- Use resource-based URLs and appropriate HTTP methods.

## Validation
- Use Pydantic schemas for all request and response validation.
- All input data must be validated and sanitized before processing.

## Error Handling
- All errors must be handled by the global exception handler.
- API responses must use the standardized `APIResponse` model.

## Documentation
- API documentation must be auto-generated via OpenAPI/Swagger.
- All endpoints must have summary and description fields for docs.
