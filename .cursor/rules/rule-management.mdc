# Cursor Rule File Management Rules

## Location
- All rule files must be located in `.cursor/rules/`.
- Never create or duplicate rule files outside this directory.

## Metadata
- Each rule file must start with a YAML metadata block (between `---` lines).
- Only update content below the metadata block; never modify the metadata except to add new fields.

## Updates
- When updating a rule, always read the full file and preserve existing metadata.
- Never duplicate rules in other locations; merge and delete duplicates.

## Validation
- Use Cursor's rule management interface to validate all rule files after changes.
