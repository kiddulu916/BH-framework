**Instructions** 
This rule contains comprehensive overview of our Architecture.

You are always to refer to this file when making any Architectual Decisions or building, tracking and making any plans. 
You are always to keep expanding this and any referred sub documents with any relevent information or plans about any levels of our architecture.

Contains sections of various high level overviews of our architecture, each section might contain a reference to additional detailed doc, if it's there super important to always refer to it.

## **High-Level Architecture**

### **System Overview**
The Bug Hunting Framework is a modular, full-stack application designed for automated, ethical security testing and comprehensive reporting. It orchestrates a multi-stage workflow (reconnaissance, vulnerability analysis, kill chain, reporting) using containerized stages, a robust backend (Django + Django Ninja), and a modern frontend (Next.js + React). The system is built for scalability, security, and maintainability, supporting both automated and user-driven workflows.

**Key Architectural Principles:**
- [x] Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- [x] Scalable and maintainable codebase
- [x] Security-first approach
- [x] Performance optimization
- [x] Code reusability and DRY principles

### **Technology Stack**
- **Backend:** Django + Django Ninja (async REST API, Pydantic validation, OpenAPI docs)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM (asyncpg, Alembic migrations, JSONB, full-text search)
- **Authentication:** JWT (HTTP-only cookies, access/refresh tokens, session management)
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14+, React, Zustand, React Query, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix UI
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose (multi-container orchestration)
- **Dev Tools:** Black, Flake8, MyPy, Pytest, HTTPX, Sphinx, Prometheus/Grafana, Bandit, Safety, Locust
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (conventional commits, PR review, test/lint pipeline)

### **Deployment Architecture**
- **Local Development:** Docker Compose orchestrates `db`, `backend`, `frontend`, and stage containers. Volumes for persistent data and outputs. `.env` for config.
- **Production:** Containerized deployment, shared bridge network, health checks, monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana), backup and disaster recovery, security hardening.

## **Domain Architecture**

### **Application Domains**
- **Bug Hunting Domain:** Stage management, workflow, data collection, target management
- **Bug Reporting Domain:** Report templates, report generation, export management
- **User Management Domain:** Authentication, profile, session handling
- **Analytics Domain:** Performance metrics, statistics, dashboards

Domains are mapped to epics and phases as tracked in `epics.mdc`. Each domain is implemented as a set of Django apps/modules, with clear boundaries and interfaces.

### **Domain Boundaries**
- **Bug Hunting** â†” **Bug Reporting:** Data flows from hunting stages to reporting
- **User Management** is cross-cutting (auth, session, profile)
- **Analytics** aggregates data from all domains
- Interfaces are defined via REST API endpoints and shared database models

---

## **Technical Architecture**

### **Data Architecture**
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, managed via SQLAlchemy ORM and Alembic migrations
- **Schema:** Core tables for users, targets, stage results (passive/active recon, vulnerabilities, kill chain, reports)
- **Data Flow:** Stage containers POST results to backend API, which validates and persists them
- **Storage:** Outputs mounted in `/outputs/<target>/<stage>/` for raw tool data
- **Security:** Data validation (Pydantic), input sanitization, at-rest and in-transit encryption

### **API Architecture**
- **Pattern:** RESTful endpoints via Django Ninja, async support
- **Auth:** JWT (access/refresh tokens, HTTP-only cookies)
- **Versioning:** URL-based (e.g., `/api/v1/`)
- **Validation:** Pydantic schemas for all requests/responses
- **Error Handling:** Standardized APIResponse model, global exception handlers
- **Docs:** OpenAPI/Swagger auto-generated

### **Frontend Architecture**
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+, React, Zustand, React Query
- **Component Library:** shadcn/ui, Radix UI
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** Zustand (global), React Query (async)
- **Real-time:** WebSocket client for live updates
- **Pages:** Dashboard, target management, stage views, reporting, user profile
- **Testing:** Vitest, Testing Library, Playwright

### **Backend Architecture**
- **Layered Structure:**
  - API (Django Ninja routers)
  - Tasks (business logic)
  - Repositories (SQLAlchemy data access)
  - Models (ORM entities)
- **Async:** End-to-end async support (ASGI, asyncpg, HTTPX for tests)
- **Dependency Injection:** Services and repositories injected into business logic
- **Background Jobs:** (Planned) Celery or similar for long-running tasks

---

## **Infrastructure Architecture**

### **Development Environment**
- **Local Dev:** Docker Compose, hot reloading, .env config, persistent volumes for db and outputs
- **Testing:** Pytest, HTTPX (ASGITransport), coverage, performance/load testing (Locust)
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus/Grafana, Sentry for error tracking

### **Production Environment**
- **Deployment:** Containerized, shared bridge network, health checks
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus/Grafana, log aggregation
- **Backup:** Automated db and output backups, disaster recovery plan
- **Security:** Hardened containers, secrets management, regular dependency scanning

---

## **Security Architecture**

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- **JWT:** Access/refresh tokens, HTTP-only cookies, 30-min access expiry, 7-day refresh
- **Session Management:** Token rotation, session invalidation, user profile isolation
- **Role-based Access:** (Planned) for admin/user separation
- **Security Headers:** Enforced via middleware

### **Data Security**
- **Encryption:** At-rest (db, outputs), in-transit (HTTPS)
- **Validation:** Pydantic schemas, input/output sanitization
- **Backup:** Encrypted backups, retention policies
- **Audit Logging:** All auth and critical actions logged
