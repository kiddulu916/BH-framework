## **High-Level Architecture**

### **System Overview**
The Bug Hunting Framework is a modular, full-stack application designed for automated, ethical security testing and comprehensive reporting. It orchestrates a multi-stage workflow (reconnaissance, vulnerability analysis, kill chain, reporting) using containerized stages, a robust backend (Django + Django Ninja), and a modern frontend (Next.js + React). The system is built for scalability, security, and maintainability, supporting both automated and user-driven workflows.

**Key Architectural Principles:**
- [x] Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- [x] Scalable and maintainable codebase
- [x] Security-first approach
- [x] Performance optimization
- [x] Code reusability and DRY principles

### **Technology Stack**
- **Backend:** Django + Django Ninja (async REST API, Pydantic validation, OpenAPI docs)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM (asyncpg, Alembic migrations, JSONB, full-text search)
- **Authentication:** JWT (HTTP-only cookies, access/refresh tokens, session management)
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15.4.2, React 19.1.0, Zustand 5.0.6, React Query, Tailwind CSS 4.0, shadcn/ui, Radix UI
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose (multi-container orchestration with health checks)
- **AI/ML Integration:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Transformers, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Playwright
- **Security Tools:** Nuclei, Nmap, Nikto, ZAP, Wapiti, Arachni, SQLMap, Hydra, Dirb, Gobuster, FFuf
- **Dev Tools:** Black, Flake8, MyPy, Pytest, HTTPX, Sphinx, Prometheus/Grafana, Bandit, Safety, Locust
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (conventional commits, PR review, test/lint pipeline)

### **Deployment Architecture**
- **Local Development:** Docker Compose orchestrates `db`, `backend`, `frontend`, and stage containers with health checks and dependencies. Volumes for persistent data and outputs. Standardized `.env` configuration.
- **Stage Containers:** Individual containers for each bug hunting stage (passive_recon, active_recon, vuln_scan, vuln_test, kill_chain, comprehensive_reporting) with resource limits and security hardening.
- **Production:** Containerized deployment, shared bridge network, comprehensive health checks, monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana), backup and disaster recovery, security hardening.
- **Resource Management:** Stage-specific resource allocation (2-4GB memory, 0.8-1.0 CPU cores) based on computational requirements.

---

## **Domain Architecture**

### **Application Domains**
- **Bug Hunting Domain:** Stage management, workflow, data collection, target management, AI/ML integration
- **Bug Reporting Domain:** Report templates, report generation, export management, stakeholder communication
- **User Management Domain:** Authentication, profile, session handling, JWT token management
- **Analytics Domain:** Performance metrics, statistics, dashboards, AI-powered insights
- **AI/ML Domain:** Vulnerability analysis, evidence processing, pattern detection, automated reporting

Domains are mapped to epics and phases as tracked in `epics.mdc`. Each domain is implemented as a set of Django apps/modules, with clear boundaries and interfaces.

### **Domain Boundaries**
- **Bug Hunting** ↔ **Bug Reporting:** Data flows from hunting stages to reporting
- **User Management** is cross-cutting (auth, session, profile)
- **Analytics** aggregates data from all domains
- Interfaces are defined via REST API endpoints and shared database models

## **Key Codebase Patterns & Enforcement**

### Backend Layered Architecture
- All backend code must follow: API (Django Ninja routers) → Tasks (business logic) → Repositories (SQLAlchemy) → Models (ORM entities).
- No business logic in API endpoints; must reside in the `tasks` layer.
- All database and API operations must use async/await patterns (ASGI, asyncpg, HTTPX).
- Use dependency injection for all services and repositories.
- All API endpoints must return the standardized `APIResponse` model.
- Use Pydantic schemas for all request/response validation.
- All errors must be handled by the global exception handler.

### Frontend Atomic & State Patterns
- All React components must be functional and use hooks for state.
- Organize components by atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages).
- Use Zustand for global state, React Query for async state/data fetching.
- Use shadcn/ui and Radix UI for UI components; style with Tailwind CSS.
- All components must implement loading and error states for async operations.
- All components must have JSDoc or TypeScript doc comments.
- All new UI libraries or design systems must be reviewed for consistency with existing patterns before adoption.

### Orchestration & Dev Environment
- Use Docker Compose to orchestrate all services (db, backend, frontend, stage containers).
- All environment variables must be documented in `.env` and referenced in Docker Compose.
- Use hot reloading for local development.
- All major dependencies and tools must be documented in the architecture or rules files.

### Real-time & State Management
- Use WebSocket for real-time updates between backend and frontend.
- State management must be centralized (Zustand) and colocated where possible.

### Testing & Documentation
- All backend code must be tested with Pytest + HTTPX (ASGITransport).
- All frontend code must be tested with Vitest and Testing Library.
- All code must be documented (docstrings, JSDoc, OpenAPI/Swagger).
- All major architectural decisions must be recorded as ADRs in this file.
- All new rules must be cross-referenced with the current architecture and epic plans.

### Tool/Library Adoption
- When introducing a new tool, library, or major dependency, document its purpose and integration pattern in the appropriate rule or architecture file.
- Review all new tools/libraries for compatibility with existing patterns before adoption.

### Checklist for Introducing New Patterns/Dependencies
- [ ] Cross-reference with architecture and epic plans
- [ ] Update this file and relevant rules/epics
- [ ] Document integration and usage patterns
- [ ] Add/expand tests and documentation as needed
- [ ] Review for security, performance, and maintainability

# [2024-06-24] Passive Recon Stage Orchestration & API Submission Pattern

## Passive Recon Stage Patterns
- All passive recon tools (Sublist3r, Amass, Subfinder, Assetfinder, Gau) are orchestrated from a single script (`run_passive_recon.py`).
- Each tool runner saves raw output to `/outputs/passive_recon/<TARGET>/<TOOL>.*`.
- Parsed data is saved to `/outputs/passive_recon/<TARGET>/parsed/<TOOL>_subdomains.json` (or similar).
- Both raw and parsed outputs are submitted to the backend API using JWT authentication (`BACKEND_JWT_TOKEN` from `.env`).
- Tool paths are configured in `.env` and must be kept up to date with installation locations.
- Error handling: Each runner and API submission is wrapped in try/except; failures are logged and do not halt the overall process. A summary of successes/failures is printed at the end.
- All environment variables and tool paths must be documented in the stage `.env` file.

## Output Directory Convention
- Raw outputs: `/outputs/passive_recon/<TARGET>/<TOOL>.*`
- Parsed outputs: `/outputs/passive_recon/<TARGET>/parsed/<TOOL>_subdomains.json` (or similar)
- Wordlists: `/usr/share/wordlists/seclists/`

## Security & Auth
- All API submissions use JWT Bearer tokens, loaded from `.env`.
- JWT secrets must be rotated regularly and never committed to version control.
- See `.env` for up-to-date tool paths and API/JWT usage instructions.
