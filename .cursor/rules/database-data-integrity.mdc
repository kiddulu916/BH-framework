# Database & Data Integrity Rules

## ORM & Migrations
- All models must use SQLAlchemy ORM with async support.
- All schema changes must be managed via Alembic migrations.

## Data Types & Relationships
- Use JSONB for flexible fields where appropriate.
- Enforce foreign keys for all relationships between tables.

## Validation & Sanitization
- All data must be validated and sanitized before being persisted.
- Use Pydantic schemas for validation at the API layer.

## Documentation
- All models must have docstrings describing their purpose and fields.
