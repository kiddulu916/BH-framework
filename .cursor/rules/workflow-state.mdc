## State
**Phase**: CONSTRUCT
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS
**Target**: Frontend Target Profile Builder
**Started**: 2025-01-27
**Current Step**: Step 2 - Component Architecture Design

## Plan
**Goal**: Create a comprehensive frontend target profile builder that allows users to create detailed target profiles aligned with bug bounty program scopes, including approved URLs, blacklisted URLs, rate limiting rules, custom headers, and other program-specific requirements.

### Epic Reference
This work aligns with **USER_EXPERIENCE_EPIC** - **PHASE 1: CORE_UI_&_AUTH_PHASE** - **TARGET_MANAGEMENT_UI_STEP**

### Step 1: Frontend Infrastructure Setup - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Set up Next.js 15.3.3 with TypeScript 5.0.0
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS 4.0 for styling
- [x] Set up Zustand 4.5.0 for state management
- [x] Configure React Query 5.0.0 for API calls
- [x] Set up Axios 1.6.0 for HTTP client
- [x] Create proper TypeScript configuration
- [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality

### Step 2: Component Architecture Design - üîÑ IN_PROGRESS
- [x] Create atomic design structure (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
- [x] Design reusable UI components (Button, Input, Select, Modal, etc.)
- [x] Create form components with validation
- [x] Design layout components (Header, Sidebar, Main content)
- [x] Create loading and error state components

### Step 3: Target Profile Schema Design - ‚è≥ PLANNED
- [ ] Extend backend target model to include bug bounty specific fields:
  - Approved URLs list
  - Blacklisted URLs list
  - Rate limiting rules (requests per minute/hour)
  - Custom headers (Authorization, User-Agent, etc.)
  - Program name and description
  - Platform (HackerOne, Bugcrowd, etc.)
  - Scope rules and restrictions
  - Contact information
  - Special instructions
- [ ] Update backend API endpoints to handle new fields
- [ ] Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces

### Step 4: Multi-Step Form Design - ‚è≥ PLANNED
- [x] Create step-by-step form wizard with progress indicator
- [x] Step 1: Basic Target Information (name, domain, description)
- [x] Step 2: Bug Bounty Program Details (platform, program name)
- [x] Step 3: Scope Configuration (approved URLs, blacklisted URLs)
- [x] Step 4: Rate Limiting & Headers (rate limits, custom headers)
- [x] Step 5: Additional Rules & Instructions
- [x] Step 6: Review & Submit

### Step 5: Form Validation & State Management - ‚è≥ PLANNED
- [x] Implement client-side validation using Zod or similar
- [x] Create form state management with Zustand
- [x] Implement step navigation with validation
- [x] Add real-time validation feedback
- [x] Create error handling and user feedback

### Step 6: API Integration - ‚è≥ PLANNED
- [x] Create API client using Axios
- [x] Implement target creation endpoint integration
- [x] Add proper error handling for API calls
- [x] Implement loading states during API calls
- [x] Add success/error notifications

### Step 7: UI/UX Design - ‚è≥ PLANNED
- [x] Design modern, intuitive interface
- [x] Implement responsive design for mobile/desktop
- [x] Add smooth transitions and animations
- [x] Create accessible components (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [x] Implement dark/light mode support

### Step 8: Testing & Quality Assurance - ‚è≥ PLANNED
- [ ] Write unit tests for components
- [ ] Write integration tests for form flows
- [ ] Test API integration
- [ ] Test responsive design
- [ ] Test accessibility features
- [ ] Performance testing

### Step 9: Documentation & Deployment - ‚è≥ PLANNED
- [ ] Update frontend README with setup instructions
- [ ] Document component usage and props
- [ ] Create user guide for target profile creation
- [ ] Update Docker configuration for frontend
- [ ] Test local development setup

## Rules

- Follow frontend architecture patterns from `.cursor/rules/project-config.mdc`
- Use Next.js 15.3.3 with App Router and Server Components
- Implement atomic design principles for component organization
- Use Tailwind CSS 4.0 for styling with custom design system
- Follow TypeScript 5.0.0 best practices with comprehensive type safety
- Use Zustand 4.5.0 for global state management
- Use React Query 5.0.0 for async state and API calls
- Use Axios 1.6.0 for HTTP client with proper error handling
- Follow security standards from `.cursor/rules/security-auth.mdc`
- Maintain accessibility standards (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- Implement responsive design for all screen sizes
- Follow testing patterns with comprehensive test coverage
