## State
**Phase**: VALIDATE
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Target**: Active Recon Stage Cleanup
**Started**: 2025-01-27

## Plan
**Goal**: Clean up the active_recon stage by removing leftover files, redundant code, updating documentation, and ensuring proper formatting.

### Step 1: Remove Leftover Files
- [x] Remove any `__pycache__` directories if found
- [x] Remove any `.tmp`, `.bak`, `.log`, `.cache` files if found
- [x] Clean up any temporary test output files

### Step 2: Remove Debug Code and Comments
- [x] Remove debug print statements from `run_linkfinder.py` (line 91)
- [x] Remove any other debug prints or commented-out code
- [x] Clean up any TODO/FIXME comments that are no longer relevant

### Step 3: Review and Update Requirements
- [x] Verify all dependencies in `requirements.txt` are actually used
- [x] Check if `mitmproxy`, `asyncio-mqtt`, `websockets` are needed
- [x] Update requirements.txt if any dependencies are unused

### Step 4: Update Documentation
- [x] Review and update `tests/README.md` if needed
- [x] Ensure documentation doesn't reference removed files
- [x] Update any obsolete instructions

### Step 5: Code Formatting and Linting
- [x] Run Black formatter on all Python files
- [x] Run Flake8 linter to check for style issues
- [x] Fix any formatting or linting issues found

### Step 6: Final Validation
- [x] Verify all tests still pass
- [x] Check that no functionality is broken
- [x] Ensure code follows project standards

## Rules
- Follow the stage container patterns from `.cursor/rules/stage-container-patterns.mdc`
- Maintain security standards from `.cursor/rules/security-auth.mdc`
- Follow Docker containerization patterns from `.cursor/rules/docker-containerization.mdc`
- Remove debug code but preserve essential logging
- Keep requirements minimal and up-to-date
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage

## Items
**Files to Clean**:
- `stages/active_recon/run_active_recon.py` - Remove debug prints
- `stages/active_recon/runners/run_linkfinder.py` - Remove debug print (line 91)
- `stages/active_recon/requirements.txt` - Review dependencies
- `stages/active_recon/tests/README.md` - Update if needed

**Files to Format**:
- All Python files in `stages/active_recon/`
