# Security & Authentication Rules

## Authentication
- Use JWT for authentication, stored in HTTP-only cookies.
- Access tokens expire in 30 minutes, refresh tokens in 7 days.
- Implement token rotation and session invalidation.

## Authorization
- (Planned) Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for admin/user separation.
- All protected endpoints must check user roles and permissions.

## Data Security
- All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit (HTTPS).
- Use Pydantic for input/output validation and sanitization.

## Audit Logging
- Log all authentication and critical actions for audit purposes.

## Security Headers
- Enforce security headers via backend middleware.
