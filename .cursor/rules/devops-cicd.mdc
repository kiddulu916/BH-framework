# DevOps & CI/CD Rules

## Containerization
- All services must be containerized using Docker.
- Use Docker Compose for local orchestration and service networking.

## CI/CD
- CI/CD must run all tests and linters on every PR.
- Use GitHub Actions for automated pipelines.

## Environment Variables
- All environment variables must be documented in `.env.example`.
- Never commit secrets or sensitive values to version control.

## Deployment
- All deployments must use the latest tested images and configuration.
- Health checks must be implemented for all critical services.
